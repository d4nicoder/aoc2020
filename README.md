# Advent of Code 2020

This is the third year that I intend to finish the Advent of Code challenge. I always leave it halfway.

Last year I did it in Go, and this one I have proposed to do it in Typescript.

Let's see if this time I finish it ...

## Run instructions

All source files are in the ./src folder and compiled in ./dist. You can run all the challenge solutions by typing:

```bash
npm start
```

## Solutions

All the solutions are in the **[results.txt](https://github.com/danitetus/aoc2020/blob/main/results.txt)** file.

## Download input

I have a script to download the inputs of any day. You have to set an environment variable called SESSION with the
content of your cookie "session" from adventofcode.com. You can also save it in an .env file
The all you have to do is write in a terminal
```bash
node getInput.js <day>  # day is the number of the day you want to download
```
