# Advent of Code 2020

This is the third year that I intend to finish the Adevent of Code challenge. I always leave it halfway.

Last year I did it in Go, and this one I have proposed to do it in Typescript.

Let's see if this time I finish it ...

## Run instructions

All source files are in the ./src folder and compiled in ./dist. You can run all the challenge solutions by typing:

```bash
npm start
```
