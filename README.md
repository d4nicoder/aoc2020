**(This repository is archived)**

These are my solutions for the Advent of code 2020. They are written in Typescript.

All source files are in the ./src folder and compiled in ./dist. You can run all the challenge solutions by typing:

npm ci
npm start
```

## Solutions

All the solutions are in the **[results.txt](https://github.com/danitetus/aoc2020/blob/main/results.txt)** file.

## Download input

I have a script to download the inputs of any day. You have to set an environment variable called SESSION with the
content of your cookie "session" from adventofcode.com. You can also save it in an .env file The all you have to do is
write in a terminal

```bash
node getInput.js <day>  # day is the number of the day you want to download
```

## MERRY X-MAS!! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ„
